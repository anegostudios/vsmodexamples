# Vintage Story Modding Examples

Welcome to the Vintage Story Modding Examples Repo.

This contains a set of content mods, made in JSON, and code mods, made using C#.

Most of these examples have follow-along tutorials on the [Vintage Story Wiki](https://wiki.vintagestory.at/index.php/Main_Page).

## Mod Examples

Each mod example has its own readme file associated with it - This will give a link to its wiki tutorial if one exists.

Most mod examples also contain two zip files, a `setup` and a `complete`. The `setup` zip file allows you to follow along with the appropriate tutorial. 

Content mods can be unzipped (or left zipped) and placed directly into the game's "mods" folder.

The code mods examples are configured using the .NET 7 templates. They should work out of the box with Visual Studio, but may require some confuration to work with other IDEs.
